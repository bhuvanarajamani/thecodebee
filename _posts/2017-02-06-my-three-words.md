At the beginning of this year, I have seen lot of action in the social media about setting goals, resolutions etc for a successful 2017. I generally don't beleive in resolutions as beaking that in the middle shakes your self-confidence. But I was intrigued by the buzz around the [3 words](http://chrisbrogan.com/3words2017/) by Chris Brogan. I found Chris' reasoning and the approach as rather simple but also impactful. After thinking and re-thinking as I wanted these 3 words to align with my goals for this year, I've finally nailed down my 3 words for 2017.

### 3 words for 2017
1. **DO** - During this year, I want to come out of the 'analysis-paralysis' mode and start *DOING* things. *DO* is a very powerful word which means accomplish, achieve, act, finish, perform, work, succeed and lot of other verbs which resonates well with my key goal for this year.
2. **SHARE** - Throughout my career, I have hit and resolved various technical / programming challenges. I have shared those with just my immediate team and close circle. Looking back after these years, I think there would be a wider community that would benefit from such learnings.
3. **PERSIST** - As I'm starting out this year with lot of bold goals, I need to *persist* irrespective of the outcome as many of these goals are unknown territory to me. 

> A dream becomes a goal when action is taken toward its achievement.
