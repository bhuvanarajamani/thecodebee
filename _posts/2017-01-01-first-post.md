After being a listener of [Pro Blogger Podcast](https://problogger.com/podcast/) for over a year, I've finally decided to start my own blog. I was intrigued by the medium but didn't start it till now as I felt no one would be interested in reading my blog. Probably that was more of an excuse to myself.

## Why this Blog?

1. **Giving back to the community** - During my various programming experiments, I've used various blogs as reference when I hit issues. This blog is my way of giving back to the community. Even if no one ever reads this blog, this would least serve as my journal & tips that lives online.
2. **Improve my writing** - Being in the world of programming / software engineering for around 2 decades, writing has come down to 'thinking in bullet points' for 'ppt presentations'. Blog is likely to improve my proficiency.
3. **Improve my learning & memory** - As I go about building various apps, I can share my learnings and tips through the blog which would make me think clearly from the readers' point of view. This would help in explaining the details in clear and succint manner.
